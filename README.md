# Overview of the project

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

The tool I will use for this case study is MS Excel 2022/GoogleSheet.

The data analytics process will follow the PMAVD (Prepare, Model, Analyze, Visualize and Dashboard) process.

## Objectives

In this dataset, I will create a dashboard that can be used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.
